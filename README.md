Notebook examples for exploring the [Explaining Markets](https://explainingmarkets.ai/)
competition API and its historical data archive — including the two disclosure items
each earnings event carries, the ten call facts and (from 2026Q3) the earnings
preview. Notebook-first, with the repeated
API / parsing / plotting boilerplate factored into a small `examples` package so the
notebooks stay short and readable.

## What's here

| Notebook | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`notebooks/00_api_quickstart.ipynb`](notebooks/00_api_quickstart.ipynb) | The read endpoints — events calendar (table + chart), submission health, archive manifest, webhook self-test |
| [`notebooks/01_historical_archive.ipynb`](notebooks/01_historical_archive.ipynb) | Download, cache, and load the historical archive, then reproduce the baseline scoring regressions (Koijen & Levy WP, Table 3) with the competition's exact scoring transform |
| [`notebooks/02_earnings_call_facts.ipynb`](notebooks/02_earnings_call_facts.ipynb) | Where each event's ten-fact `disclosure` comes from — the exact prompt, model config, and parsing behind it, and how extraction failures surface |
| [`notebooks/03_earnings_previews.ipynb`](notebooks/03_earnings_previews.ipynb) | The **earnings preview** — the result of running [Anthropic's Earnings Preview Skill](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services/blob/main/plugins/agent-plugins/earnings-reviewer/skills/earnings-preview/SKILL.md) prior to each earnings announcement. Starting Q4 2026, events carry this as a second disclosure item. The notebook covers how it is built, what it looks like, and how it pairs with the facts |

All four run top-to-bottom. With an API key they hit the live API; **without one they
fall back to a small bundled sample** (`data/sample/`), so you can run them — and CI
can execute them — with no credentials.

> **Submitting predictions is out of scope here.** `POST /predictions` places a
> real, scored entry and belongs in a *deployed* webhook handler. Start from the
> [`starter-modal`](https://github.com/explaining-markets/starter-modal) (or
> `starter-railway`) repos for that.

## Setup

This repo uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From a clone:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env      # then paste your submission's API key (optional)
uv run jupyter lab
```

No key yet? Skip the `.env` step and everything still runs in sample mode.

`.env.example` also has an optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. It is **not** a competition
credential — only the last section of notebook 02 uses it, to run the real fact-extraction
call so you can watch it happen. Leave it blank and that section self-skips.

## Using the helpers outside a notebook

```python
from examples import Client
from examples.frames import events_frame

with Client.from_env() as client:
    events = client.events()

events_frame(events).head()
```

## Repo layout

```text
notebooks/   the numbered, narrative examples
src/examples/  helper package: config · client · schemas · frames · plotting · archive · scoring · summary · preview
scripts/     small runnable scripts (e.g. headless archive download)
tests/       offline unit tests (mocked HTTP + bundled sample data)
data/
  sample/    tiny, committed, illustrative data
  archive/   gitignored download cache for real archive files
```

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run ruff format .         # format
uv run mypy                  # type-check
uv run pytest                # offline unit tests
uv run pytest --nbmake notebooks/   # execute the notebooks (sample mode)
uv run pre-commit install    # strip notebook outputs + lint on commit
```

CI runs all of the above on every push and pull request. Live tests (`-m live`)
need `EM_API_KEY` and are excluded by default.
