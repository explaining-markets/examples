"""Typed models for the public API responses we exercise in the notebooks.

These mirror the competition's OpenAPI schemas (``/docs/api``). They are
deliberately **lenient** — ``extra="allow"`` — so unknown or newly added fields
pass through untouched rather than raising. Event types in particular are an
open string set — currently only ``EARNINGS_RELEASE`` is emitted — so we keep
them as plain ``str`` and never validate against a closed enum; new types can
appear without breaking parsing.

Only the read/exercise endpoints are modeled here. Prediction *submission*
(``POST /predictions``) is intentionally omitted — that belongs to a live agent
running in a deployed webhook handler, not to these examples.
