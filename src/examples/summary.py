"""Explaining Markets earnings-call fact-extraction summarizer.

Every ``EARNINGS_RELEASE`` event you receive carries a ``disclosure`` block whose
``items`` include one with ``kind="facts"`` and ``source="earnings_call"``. Its
``content`` is a list of exactly "facts." This module is the call that
produces them, so you can see what the extraction optimizes for rather than
treating the facts as an opaque input.

The production request is deliberately plain: a ``system`` string, one ``user``
message, and extended thinking. There is **no tool use, no JSON schema, no
``response_format``, and no ``temperature``** — the ten-fact JSON structure is
enforced by the prompt text alone and then validated after the fact by
:func:`parse_facts` / :func:`recover_facts`. That is worth knowing: the model is
free-forming its output, and the ``parse_note`` you may see in an artifact
records how cleanly it did so.

:data:`SUMMARY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, :data:`SUMMARY_USER_TEMPLATE`,
:data:`MODEL_CONFIGS`, :func:`parse_facts` and :func:`recover_facts` are exact
semantic ports of the production summarizer — fence stripping, bracket repair,
trim-to-ten and every failure note included — so a request you build here is
byte-identical to the one the pipeline sends. :func:`format_transcript` is the
same renderer the pipeline feeds it.

Typical use::

    from examples.summary import build_request, format_transcript

    md = format_transcript(transcript)          # what the model actually sees
    params = build_request(md)                  # the exact Messages API kwargs
    print(params["system"])
    print(params["messages"][0]["content"])
